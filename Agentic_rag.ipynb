It is also known as neural networks or neural nets. An artificial neural networkâ€™s input layer, which is the first layer, receives input from external sources and passes it on to the hidden layer, which is the second layer. Each neuron in the hidden layer gets information from the neurons in the previous layer, computes the weighted total, and then transfers it to the neurons in the next layer.

The whole Artificial Neural Network is composed of these artificial neurons, which are arranged in a series of layers. The complexities of neural networks will depend on the complexities of the underlying patterns in the dataset whether a layer has a dozen units or millions of units.  Commonly, Artificial Neural Network has an input layer, an output layer as well as hidden layers. The input layer receives data from the outside world which the neural network needs to analyze or learn about.\\n\\nIn a fully connected artificial neural network, there is an input layer and one or more hidden layers connected one after the other.

This is used in applications such as customer service, social media monitoring, and political analysis. \\nSpeech recognition: Deep learning models can recognize and transcribe spoken words, making it possible to perform tasks such as speech-to-text conversion, voice search, and voice-controlled devices. \\n3. Reinforcement learning: \\nIn reinforcement learning, deep learning works as training agents to take action in an environment to maximize a reward. Some of the main applications of deep learning in reinforcement learning include:\\n\\nMachine Learning\\n\\nDeep Learning\\n\\nApply statistical algorithms to learn the hidden patterns and relationships in the dataset.\\tUses artificial neural network architecture to learn the hidden patterns and relationships in the dataset.\\nCan work on the smaller amount of dataset\\tRequires the larger volume of dataset compared to machine learning\\nBetter for the low-label task.\\tBetter for complex task like image processing, natural language processing, etc.\\nTakes less time to train the model.\\tTakes more time to train the model.\\nA model is created by relevant features which are manually extracted from images to detect an object in the image.\\tRelevant features are automatically extracted from images. It is an end-to-end learning process.\\nLess complex and easy to interpret the result.\\tMore complex, it works like the black box interpretations of the result are not easy.\\nIt can work on the CPU or requires less computing power as compared to deep learning.\\tIt requires a high-performance computer with GPU.\\nTypes of neural networks\\nDeep Learning models are able to automatically learn features from the data, which makes them well-suited for tasks such as image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing. The most widely used architectures in deep learning are feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs).\\n\\nReinforcement  Machine Learning: Reinforcement  Machine Learning is the machine learning technique in which an agent learns to make decisions in an environment to maximize a reward signal. The agent interacts with the environment by taking action and observing the resulting rewards. Deep learning can be used to learn policies, or a set of actions, that maximizes the cumulative reward over time. Deep reinforcement learning algorithms like Deep Q networks and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) are used to reinforce tasks like robotics and game playing etc.\\nArtificial neural networks\\nArtificial neural networks are built on the principles of the structure and operation of human neurons. It is also known as neural networks or neural nets. An artificial neural networkâ€™s input layer, which is the first layer, receives input from external sources and passes it on to the hidden layer, which is the second layer. Each neuron in the hidden layer gets information from the neurons in the previous layer, computes the weighted total, and then transfers it to the neurons in the next layer. These connections are weighted, which means that the impacts of the inputs from the preceding layer are more or less optimized by giving each input a distinct weight. These weights are then adjusted during the training process to enhance the performance of the model.\\n\\nThe definition of Deep learning is that it is the branch of machine learning that is based on artificial neural network architecture. An artificial neural network or ANN uses layers of interconnected nodes called neurons that work together to process and learn from the input data.\\n\\nIn a fully connected Deep neural network, there is an input layer and one or more hidden layers connected one after the other. Each neuron receives input from the previous layer neurons or the input layer. The output of one neuron becomes the input to other neurons in the next layer of the network, and this process continues until the final layer produces the output of the network. The layers of the neural network transform the input data through a series of nonlinear transformations, allowing the network to learn complex representations of the input data.\\n\\nDeep Learning - Geeksforgeeks\\nScope of Deep Learning\\n\\nToday Deep learning AI has become one of the most popular and visible areas of machine learning, due to its success in a variety of applications, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and Reinforcement learning.\\n\\nDeep learning AI can be used for supervised, unsupervised as well as reinforcement machine learning. it uses a variety of ways to process these.', name='database retriever', id='e6a1d693-a4ce-4056-b004-52e3879f47d5', tool_call_id='call_q1ty'), AIMessage(content='Here are a few ways to rephrase \"Who is the president of India?\":\\n\\n**More formal:**\\n\\n*  What is the name of the current president of India?\\n*  Who holds the office of President of India?\\n\\n**More conversational:**\\n\\n*  Who\\'s the president of India right now? \\n\\n\\nThe best option depends on the context of your writing or conversation. \\n', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 85, 'prompt_tokens': 48, 'total_tokens': 133, 'completion_time': 0.154545455, 'prompt_time': 0.000546429, 'queue_time': 0.01966258, 'total_time': 0.155091884}, 'model_name': 'gemma2-9b-it', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_10c08bf97d', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-49edbd19-565a-466f-8824-d6292df9e6d2-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 48, 'output_tokens': 85, 'total_tokens': 133})]\n"

This is used in applications such as customer service, social media monitoring, and political analysis. \\nSpeech recognition: Deep learning models can recognize and transcribe spoken words, making it possible to perform tasks such as speech-to-text conversion, voice search, and voice-controlled devices. \\n3. Reinforcement learning: \\nIn reinforcement learning, deep learning works as training agents to take action in an environment to maximize a reward. Some of the main applications of deep learning in reinforcement learning include:\\n\\nMachine Learning\\n\\nDeep Learning\\n\\nApply statistical algorithms to learn the hidden patterns and relationships in the dataset.\\tUses artificial neural network architecture to learn the hidden patterns and relationships in the dataset.\\nCan work on the smaller amount of dataset\\tRequires the larger volume of dataset compared to machine learning\\nBetter for the low-label task.\\tBetter for complex task like image processing, natural language processing, etc.\\nTakes less time to train the model.\\tTakes more time to train the model.\\nA model is created by relevant features which are manually extracted from images to detect an object in the image.\\tRelevant features are automatically extracted from images. It is an end-to-end learning process.\\nLess complex and easy to interpret the result.\\tMore complex, it works like the black box interpretations of the result are not easy.\\nIt can work on the CPU or requires less computing power as compared to deep learning.\\tIt requires a high-performance computer with GPU.\\nTypes of neural networks\\nDeep Learning models are able to automatically learn features from the data, which makes them well-suited for tasks such as image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing. The most widely used architectures in deep learning are feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs).\\n\\nReinforcement  Machine Learning: Reinforcement  Machine Learning is the machine learning technique in which an agent learns to make decisions in an environment to maximize a reward signal. The agent interacts with the environment by taking action and observing the resulting rewards. Deep learning can be used to learn policies, or a set of actions, that maximizes the cumulative reward over time. Deep reinforcement learning algorithms like Deep Q networks and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) are used to reinforce tasks like robotics and game playing etc.\\nArtificial neural networks\\nArtificial neural networks are built on the principles of the structure and operation of human neurons. It is also known as neural networks or neural nets. An artificial neural networkâ€™s input layer, which is the first layer, receives input from external sources and passes it on to the hidden layer, which is the second layer. Each neuron in the hidden layer gets information from the neurons in the previous layer, computes the weighted total, and then transfers it to the neurons in the next layer. These connections are weighted, which means that the impacts of the inputs from the preceding layer are more or less optimized by giving each input a distinct weight. These weights are then adjusted during the training process to enhance the performance of the model.\\n\\nThe definition of Deep learning is that it is the branch of machine learning that is based on artificial neural network architecture. An artificial neural network or ANN uses layers of interconnected nodes called neurons that work together to process and learn from the input data.\\n\\nIn a fully connected Deep neural network, there is an input layer and one or more hidden layers connected one after the other. Each neuron receives input from the previous layer neurons or the input layer. The output of one neuron becomes the input to other neurons in the next layer of the network, and this process continues until the final layer produces the output of the network. The layers of the neural network transform the input data through a series of nonlinear transformations, allowing the network to learn complex representations of the input data.\\n\\nDeep Learning - Geeksforgeeks\\nScope of Deep Learning\\n\\nToday Deep learning AI has become one of the most popular and visible areas of machine learning, due to its success in a variety of applications, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and Reinforcement learning.\\n\\nDeep learning AI can be used for supervised, unsupervised as well as reinforcement machine learning. it uses a variety of ways to process these.', name='database retriever', id='e6a1d693-a4ce-4056-b004-52e3879f47d5', tool_call_id='call_q1ty'),\n",

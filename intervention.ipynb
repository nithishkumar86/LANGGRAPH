India won the match by six wickets—its second World Cup win after the 1983 tournament—and became the third team to have won the title more than once, after Australia (1987, 1999, 2003, 2007) and the West Indies (1975 and 1979).[3]\\nIndia became the first country to win Cricket World Cup in their own country.\\n Change in the Sri Lanka team[edit]\\nAfter some days of deliberation, Kumar Sangakkara, the Sri Lankan captain, announced on 5 April that he was resigning from the post of captain of the One Day International and Twenty20 sides in the long-term interest of the team. However, three years later, Sri Lankan Police suspended the match fixing probe citing lack of sufficient evidence.[35] Later International Cricket Council rubbished the match fixing claims made by Ranatunga and Aluthgamage.[36]\\nIn popular culture[edit]\\nThe match formed the climax of 2016 Indian film M.S.

S. Bindra, chairman of the Monitoring Committee of the Asian bid, said that their promise of extra profits of around US$400\\xa0million had been decisive,[14] that there \"was no quid pro quo for their support\",[15] and that playing the West Indies had \"nothing to do with the World Cup bid\".[15]\\nFormat[edit]\\nLate in 2007, the four host nations agreed on a revised format for the 2011 World Cup, identical to that of the 1996 World Cup, except that there would be 14 teams instead of 12. The first match was played between India and Bangladesh at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur, Dhaka.[6]\\nPakistan was also scheduled to be a co-host, but after the 2009\\'s terrorist attack on the Sri Lanka national cricket team in Lahore, the International Cricket Council (ICC) cancelled that,[7] and the headquarters of the organising committee, originally in Lahore, was transferred to Mumbai.[8] Pakistan was to have held 14 matches, including one semi-final.[9] Eight of the games (including the semi-final) were awarded to India, four to Sri Lanka, and two to Bangladesh.[10]\\nHost selection[edit]\\n Preparations[edit]\\nPakistan loses co-host status[edit]\\nIn April 2009, the ICC announced that Pakistan had lost its right to co-host the 2011 World Cup because of concerns about the \"uncertain security situation\" in the country, especially in the aftermath of the 2009 attack on the Sri Lanka national cricket team in Lahore.[19][20] The New Zealand government had given assurance that Zimbabwe would be allowed to compete in the tournament, following political discussions in the country over whether their cricket team should be allowed to tour Zimbabwe in 2005.[citation needed]\\nThe extra time needed for the Asian bid had weakened its prospects, but when the time came to vote, Asia won the hosting rights by ten votes to three.[11] In official ICC matches match referees are required to help officiate a game, but due to the changes in the rules none were appointed for any of the warm-up games.[48][51]\\nSchedule and results[edit]\\nWarm-up matches[edit]\\nGroup stage[edit]\\nThe top four teams from each group qualified for the quarter-finals (indicated in green).\\n'}]"

These networks use layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) to process and learn from input data.  In a fully connected deep neural network, information flows through input and one or more hidden layers, with each neuron's output becoming the input for others in the next layer.  This process, involving nonlinear transformations, allows the network to learn complex representations of the input data.  Deep learning's success has made it a popular area of machine learning, used in applications such as computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning.
